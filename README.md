# TicTacToe Game
NS SW Craftsmanship Dojo's first lesson.

## Reviewers' guide
1. Codebase Navigation:
The App is build with three main classes: Game for controlling the plays of the game, Robot for executing each player movements and Board for controlling the status of the board.
The project structure is:
- Sources folder has the game code
- Tests folder has the tests of Robot and Board
- Run contains the bonary to run the game
2. Working Software Showcase:
If you are using Macos with Apple Sillicon please open Run folder in the terminal and execute TicTacToe-MacOS-Arm64 file. The game will play itself each time you execute it.
If you are using another machine/OS you will need to have VS Code and execute the code from there.
3. Codebase Analysis Tools:
The project was develop with these extensions installed in VS Code:
- CodeLLDB
- Swift
- SwiftLint 
4. Documentation of Thinking Process and Coding Flow:
The thought behin this code was to do the smallest and simplest piece of code I could do.
5. Time to solve the challenge:
It took me around 3 hours to finish the assigment. 
6. Future Ideas/Spikes/Implementations:
It would be nice to not use random number generator as the provider of the decisions of the Robots. It would be nice to prepare some "learning" that the robots would do to get better in playing each game, until they do the most opitmal move each time and they always draw the game.
